# WeatherDashboard
Module 6 Challenge

# Description

My Motivation for this challenge was to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. This application uses Third-party APIs allowing me to access their data and functionality by making request with specific parameters to a URL.  The weather dashboard uses an API key from openweathermap allowing users to retrieve weather data from cities.

# Installation

N/A

# Usage 

The web application begins with a search for a city text bar.  User is able to type in a city in the search bar.  The dashboard will display the current and future weather conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history located under the search bar.  Each city input will display the city name, the date, an icon for weather condition, the temperature, the humidity and the wind speed.  The application will also provide a 5 day forecast for the specified city.
